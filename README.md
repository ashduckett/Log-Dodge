# Log-Dodge
This is a simple iOS game I made in Swift. It's not yet finished, but it's my first attempt and would like to finish it. You have a constantly moving boat with which you have to avoid logs coming down the screen.

## Running

Once on your iOS device it's extremely simple. You move the boat (which is just a weird looking and ugly sprite at the moment) to the left
and to the right by swiping in those directions. Get the boat in between the gaps as the logs come down to get a point. It's that simple.
